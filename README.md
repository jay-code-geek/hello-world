# hello-world
a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

My mind races as think to myself, "Am I really ready to jump in the world of web-dev?"
guess only time will tell. Hello guys my name is Nqobile Juwao Magudu and for me web-dev is more than just programming.
I believe code plays a huge role in our lives. I have been In love with computers and everything about em, eversince floppy disks...
Just kidding I was born In 1998 and what I mean Is I've been a techie tinkering with PCs since birth. I personally see web-dev as a profession where I can
grow infinitely, honestly, with constant improvement from constant practice - nothing will hinder me from achieving programming mastery. With this bootcamp I believe I have dipped my toes into the tech world. And I will rule it, you may question "Who is this guy, to make such bold claims?".
Well I am an enthusiastic and hard-working fellow, my personality is my biggest asset,I say this not because of only my natural curiosity and dedication to learning new ideas, concepts and topics but also my willingness to go above and beyond what is required of me.During my life so far, I have been an enthusiastic observer
of brilliant people who succeed in life and fulfill their roles in the betterment of society and those who just don't care. I strive to be the former.Thank You
